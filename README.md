# CapstoneRaylibProject
This is a Raylib project that I wrote in 2022, in my final year of High-School. It's a simple game where you score points by shooting randomly generated barrels that spawn all around a randomly generated map.

The 'game.c' file should be able to be compiled on your own machine using Raylib. Information about Raylib can be found on https://www.raylib.com/. The exe file is exactly the output from compilation of the code.
